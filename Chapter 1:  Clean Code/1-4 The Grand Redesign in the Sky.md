### The Grand Redesign in the Sky

The grand redesign process can extend for an extensive period, sometimes spanning a decade or more. As time elapses, the original members of the tiger team who initiated the overhaul have typically moved on, leaving their successors to grapple with the aftermath. Often, these new team members find themselves advocating for yet another redesign, given the sheer disorder that has accumulated.

In this race against time, two teams vie for supremacy. The tiger team faces the monumental task of constructing a new system mirroring the full functionality of the old one. Moreover, they must keep pace with ongoing changes in the existing system. Management's stance is resolute: the old system won't be replaced until the new one can seamlessly replicate all its functions.

A fresh start beckons with the formation of a new tiger team, a coveted opportunity to embark on a green-field project and craft a pristine system. However, only the best and brightest secure a place on this elite team, while the rest continue to toil in maintaining the current, beleaguered system.

Ultimately, the team's revolt against the arduous codebase, characterized as odious, compels them to confront management. They demand a comprehensive redesign, despite management's reluctance to allocate resources for such a substantial project. However, the undeniable reality of plummeting productivity leaves management with no choice but to concede to the developers' demands, authorizing the grand redesign in the sky - i.e. to replan it all from the start.
