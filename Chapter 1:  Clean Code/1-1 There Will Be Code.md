### Part 1.1: There Will Be Code

It has been suggested by some that the era of coding is nearing its end, with models and requirements taking precedence. The idea is that soon all code will be generated rather than written, rendering programmers obsolete as business professionals generate programs from specifications. It's interesting to note that this book was written in 2008 and yet still much about this same discussion is still fresh, specially with the rapid and recent surge of generative ai models such as ChatGPT and Bard.

However, this notion is unfounded. Code is indispensable because it embodies the intricacies of requirements. Certain details can't be abstract away ; they must be explicitly defined. Specifying requirements with the precision necessary for machine execution constitutes  what is, essentially, what programming means.

While it's likely that our programming languages will become more abstract, and domain-specific languages will proliferate, this evolution won't eradicate code. Even specifications in these higher-level languages or domain-specific languages are substantially code. They still demand rigor, accuracy, and a level of formality and detail that machines can comprehend and execute.

Anticipating that code will vanish is like hoping for a symphony without any sheet music. It's like wishing for machines to understand our thoughts instead of our clear instructions, making vague requirements into precise programs. But this dream is unlikely to come true.

Even humans, despite their creativity, struggle to create successful systems when they have unclear instructions. The process of specifying requirements shows that well-defined requirements are a lot like code and can be used as tests for that code.

It's really important to understand that code is how we express what we need in software. Even if we make languages and tools that are better suited to our needs, getting rid of the need for precision is very hard. So, code will always be a big part of making software.
