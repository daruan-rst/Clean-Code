### Bad Code

The consequences of neglecting good code become painfully evident as we wade through the quagmire of poorly written software. Many of us, experienced programmers included, have encountered this impediment numerous times. It's an all-too-familiar scenario, often characterized by rushed development, looming deadlines, and the pressure to deliver.

One of the primary reasons behind writing dissatisfactory code is the pursuit of speed and the pressure of deadlines. Sometimes, it's the belief that there's no time for meticulous coding or fear of displeasing superiors. Fatigue, the desire to move on, or the weight of unfulfilled commitments might also contribute. We've all succumbed to the temptation of leaving a messy codebase for future cleanup, only to discover that, as LeBlanc's law states, "Later equals never."

The undeniable reality is that bad code significantly obstructs progress. We've all been in situations where we've had to wade through such code, searching for hints amid the senseless complexity. The question then arises: Why do we write bad code ourselves?
